            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>My name is <b>Ga Eun Cho</b> (조가은, pronounced: GAH-un JOH). I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Johns Hopkins University and a Graduate Fellow at the Chloe Center for the Critical Study of Racism, Immigration, and Colonialism. I am serving as the Associate Editor of the Cambridge Politics and Society in East Asia series. This year, I am completing my dissertation fieldwork as a Junior Fellow at the International Center for Korean Studies in the Kyujanggak Institute at Seoul National University.
</p>
                <br>
                <p>My research interests span Political Economy of Development, Migration and Security, and East Asian Politics and Society. Specifically, I am interested in the interconnections between state goals, such as economic development, postcolonial reconstruction, modernization, and Cold War survival, and boundary-making strategies, including nation-building, migration, and citizenship policies. My reserach intervenes in key debates across multiple fields: In Political Economy, I ask how latecomer states pursue economic development through social engineering of populations; in International Relations, I ask whether migrations and diasporas are beneficial or to state’s economies, politics, and societies; and in East Asian Studies, I explore how to explain South Korea’s political transition and economic development in context of post-colonialism and Cold War. I approach these questions from a transnational historical perspective, highlighting the movements, connections, and influence of diverse actors across time and space.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My dissertation, titled <i>Rethinking Migration and Development: The Politics of Emigration in South Korea</i> examines state-led emigration and diaspora engagement policies as strategies of economic development. While conventional understanding of migration policy emphasizes remittances and other tangible economic gains from sending citizens abroad, I show how South Korea promoted the emigration of populations it considered less compatible with its nation-building and modernization goals. I call this a strategy of “economic development through exclusion.” I analyze this through a comparison of three state-led emigration policies, each targeting different populations and destinations: transnational adoption, temporary labor migration to Germany, and agricultural migration/family relocation to South America. In doing so, my work  shifts attention away from the dominant focus in the on labor migration from the Global South to the Global North, to diverse patterns and contexts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>These findings have broader historical and comparative implications on how different states engage with, restrict, or encourage migration, even in the absense of immediate utilitarian benefits. Why push out major sources of low-wage labor by enforcing strict measures against undocumented immigrants? Why repress political dissidents abroad despite risk of sanctions? I argue that such policies are better understood as part of a state’s effort to control the boundaries of belonging in service of broader state goals such as economic development or regime stability.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I adopt a transnational historical approach, using a mix of qualitative methods including archival, fieldwork and interview research in English, Korean, and mixed Chinese-Korean mixed script. My fieldwork has been supported by competitive grants I have won from the Kyujanggak Institute at Seoul National University, as well as from the East Asian Studies program, the Chloe Center for the Critical Study of Racism, Immigration, and Colonialism, and the Political Science Department at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I obtained my MA in International Relations from Seoul National University and a BA in Asian Studies and Economics from Yonsei University.</p>

                <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                <p>My teaching philosophy centers on cultivating students' ability to think critically and independently by engaging with primary and secondary sources. I design activities that require students to analyze data, recognize bias, and draw their own evidence-based conclusions. I also encourage students to look for the interrelatedness of different geographic contexts and historical temporalities. In the classroom, I foster an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives can be shared respectfully, encouraging rigorous dialogue.</P>
