            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>My name is <b>Ga Eun Cho</b> (조가은, pronounced: GAH-un JOH). I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Johns Hopkins University and a Graduate Fellow at the Chloe Center for the Critical Study of Racism, Immigration, and Colonialism. I am serving as the Associate Editor of the Cambridge Politics and Society in East Asia series. This year, I am completing my dissertation fieldwork as a Junior Fellow at the International Center for Korean Studies in the Kyujanggak Institute at Seoul National University.
</p>
                <br>
                <p>My research interests span Political Economy of Development, Migration and Security, and East Asian Politics and Society. Across these fields, I demonstrate that development has been conceived in a way that justifies and even necessitates mobility and exclusion. Specifically, I am interested in the interconnections between state goals, such as economic development, postcolonial reconstruction, modernization, and Cold War survival, and boundary-making strategies, including nation-building, migration, and citizenship policies. My reserach intervenes in key debates across multiple fields: In Political Economy, I ask how latecomer states pursue economic development through population engineering; in International Relations, I ask whether migrations and diasporas are beneficial or to state’s economies, politics, and societies; and in East Asian Studies, I explore how to explain South Korea’s political transition and economic development in context of post-colonialism and Cold War. I approach these questions from a transnational historical perspective, highlighting the movements, connections, and influence of diverse actors across time and space.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My dissertation, <i>Rethinking Migration and Development: The Politics of Emigration in South Korea</i> examines state-led emigration and diaspora engagement policies as strategies of economic development. 
                    Migration was central to the state’s vision of progress as a mechanism for defining and policing national membership. Drawing on archival and interview-based fieldwork, I show how emigration policies were part of broader population engineering strategies, such as sterilization programs and anti-communist purges during the Cold War. I argue that South Korea’s mass emigration policies, initiated in the early 1960s, were also a mechanism for defining the “modern” Korean population by excluding certain groups deemed undesirable.
                    I analyze this through a comparison of three state-led emigration policies, each targeting different populations and destinations: transnational adoption, temporary labor migration to Germany, and agricultural migration/family relocation to South America. In doing so, my work  shifts attention away from the dominant focus in the on labor migration from the Global South to the Global North, to diverse patterns and contexts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Existing scholarship on migration and development emphasizes remittances and other tangible economic gains from sending citizens abroad. In contrast, I argue that sociopolitical exclusion lies at the heart of development itself. By reconceptualizing development as a process of exclusion rather than solely economic growth, I contribute to debates in comparative political economy, migration and citizenship studies, and the study of latecomer economic development. This framework recasts exclusionary policies, such as displacement, emigration, and revocation of citizenship, from anomalies or side effects of development into its central facets. 
                    These findings have broader historical and comparative implications on how different states engage with, restrict, or encourage migration, even in the absense of immediate utilitarian benefits. Why push out major sources of low-wage labor by enforcing strict measures against undocumented immigrants? Why repress political dissidents abroad despite risk of sanctions? I argue that such policies are better understood as part of a state’s effort to control the boundaries of belonging in service of broader state goals such as economic development or regime stability.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I adopt a transnational historical approach, using a mix of qualitative methods including archival, fieldwork and interview research in English, Korean, and mixed Chinese-Korean mixed script. My fieldwork has been supported by competitive grants I have won from the Kyujanggak Institute at Seoul National University, as well as from the East Asian Studies program, the Chloe Center for the Critical Study of Racism, Immigration, and Colonialism, and the Political Science Department at Johns Hopkins University.</p>

                Exile by Paperwork: Paradox of Migration and Bureaucratic Violence in Post-Colonial South Korea ▼

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Why do states simultaneously encourage and criminalize the same migrants? This paper argues that the paradoxes of migration in IR literature—liberal, illiberal, postcolonial, and diasporic—stem not from tensions between inherently ‘good’ and ‘bad’ migrants, but from states’ structural inability to maintain such distinctions under conditions of transnational mobility. States spatialize the anxiety, rendering space outside and mobility to such spaces as proxy for ideological contamination and political threat. In response, they employ what this paper constructs as “bureaucratic violence,” the strategic deployment of administrative procedures as mechanisms of exclusion and discipline. Bureaucratic violence operates through dual instrumentality, where the same tools such as passports facilitate and constrain movement; strategic ambiguity, where states exploit rather than resolve such categorical uncertainty; and legal deniability, where they frame political exclusion as administrative procedure. Thus, bureaucratic violence creates “exile by paperwork” where migrants are prevented from return and coerced to ideological conformity through bureaucratic suspension rather than formal banishment. Drawing on South Korea’s migration governance from the 1950s-2010s, I analyze how the state encouraged cross-border movement while simultaneously criminalizing mobile populations through fabricated espionage cases. More than half of individuals targeted were those whose movement the state promoted: students, workers, diaspora returnees, defectors, kidnapped fishermen, colonial diasporas, and residents of recovered territories. This paper reveals that contradictions in migration governance are not policy failures but constitutive features of governing mobility while maintaining the fiction of bounded national identity in the context of transnational mobility.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This chapter analyzes why the Eisenhower administration in the United States decided to compromise to Syngman Rhee’s brinkmanship strategy of releasing anti-communist prisoners during the Korean War and agreed to sign the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and Korea (US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty). To this end, this chapter analyzes the perceptions of five key decision-makers in the administration; President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson, US Ambassador to Korea Briggs, and UNC Commander-in-chief Clark. The time frame of the research is from the release of anti-communist prisoners by Rhee on June 19, 1953, until the signing of the NSC154/1 on July 3, 1953, which promised the US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. This study concludes that the perceptions of the decision-makers on Rhee’s intentions and rationales were integral in the decision-making process.

                Formulation and Systemization of Transnational Adoption Policy During Park Chung-Hee’s Regime ▼

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> In the aftermaths of the Korean War, South Korea aggressively promoted transnational adoption as an alternative to social welfare for children in need. In particular, the Park Chung-hee administration gave birth to Korea’s transnational adoption policy with the enactment of the “Intercountry adoption law with regard to the orphans” in 1961 but also continued to send children abroad despite the international scrutiny it faced due to the practice in the 1970s. This study argues that it was during the Park Chung-hee regime that transnational adoption became systemized in Korea. This study discovers the relationship between the Korean government’s modernization discourse, the collusion of the Korean society, the demand for adoption in the international society, and the growth of adoption agencies in rearing the policy of transnational adoption in Korea. The Korean government’s modernization discourse contributed to the formulation of the transnational adoption policy. Moreover, the government had been influenced by the discourse in the international society, transferred the responsibility for social welfare to adoption agencies in exchange for the guarantee of monopolization of the adoption market, and colluded with the Korean domestic society which was also under the influence of the international discourse. The international society and the adoption agencies, and in turn, the adoption agencies and Korean society were linked in a series of mutually reinforcing relationships. As such, this study demonstrates that the Korean government, focused on modernization as defined solely by economic growth, discriminated the problematic population that did not contribute to the goal from those that did, and that the offspring of such discrimination yet continues.

    <p>My primary goals are to help students develop critical thinking skills, understand how to analyze complex political phenomena, and recognize the interconnections between different regions and time periods. I aim to foster intellectual curiosity and equip students with analytical tools they can apply beyond the classroom, whether in future academic work, professional careers, or civic engagement.</p>
    
    <p>I am committed to creating an inclusive learning environment that recognizes students have different needs and pathways to success. I work to ensure that diverse voices can participate fully in classroom dialogue.</p>
    
   <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Teaching Methods</h3>
<p>I employ diverse teaching methods that actively engage students in analyzing and creating primary and secondary sources while recognizing bias. I structure each course session around both a thematic focus and an analytical tool, allowing students to anchor substantive discussions while developing transferable intellectual skills such as identifying causal mechanisms or analyzing historical contingency.</p>

<p>My assignments immerse students in knowledge production processes through hands-on activities. These include dissecting archival materials to replicate and evaluate scholarly arguments, and creating original research projects from institutional perspectives to understand how position shapes analysis.</p>
